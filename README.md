Histograms_of_full_samples_and_subsamples

The histograms are named with the file name, the normalized parameter, and a number.
Inside the histogram, the condition used is specified.

# Folders:

Astrometric_Selection_Subsamples - This folder contains histograms of 218 subsamples (654 histograms of normalized parameters)
Astrometric selection includes the 1897754 quasars in Gaia DR3. They are indicated by
the astrometric_selection_flag in the qso_candidates table.

Gaia_CRF3_Sources_Subsamples - This folder contains histograms of 218 subsamples (654 histograms of normalized parameters).
QSO candidates used to define Gaia CRF3.

Gaia_Non_CRF3_Sources_Subsamples - This folder contains histograms of 201 subsamples (603 histograms of normalized parameters).
QSO candidates not used to define Gaia CRF3.

Sources_in_Gaia_not_in_Quaia_Subsamples - This folder contains histograms of 3 subsamples (9 histograms of normalized parameters) .
Sources not selected by the Quaia catalogue.

Sources_in_Gaia_and_Quaia_Subsamples - This folder contains histograms of 3 subsamples (9 histograms of normalized parameters).
Sources found commonly in Gaia and Quaia catlogue.

# The rest of the folders contain three histograms each for the normalized parameters.  

Sources_in_LMC_,
Sources_not_in_LMC,
Sources_in_SMC,
Sources_not_in_SMC,
Sources_in_External_Catalogues

# Plots of the statistics of all the subsamples (648) are also given.
