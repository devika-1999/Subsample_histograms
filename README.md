Histograms_of_full_samples_and_subsamples

The plots are named in the following order:
file name_normalized parameter_a number.
The histogram is labeled with the condition used for making the subsample.

# Folders:

Astrometric_Selection_Subsamples - This folder contains histograms of 218 subsamples (654 histograms of normalized parameters)
